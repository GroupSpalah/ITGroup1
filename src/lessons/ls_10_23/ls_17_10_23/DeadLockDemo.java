/**
 * If you run DeadlockDemo, you will probably see only a single line of output before the application freezes.
 * To unfreeze DeadlockDemo, press Ctrl-C (assuming you are using Sun's SDK 1.4 toolkit at a Windows command prompt).
 * What causes the deadlock? Look carefully at the source code; the deposit thread must acquire two locks before
 * it can enter its innermost critical code section. The outer lock associates with the FinTrans object that
 * ft references, and the inner lock associates with the String object that anotherSharedLock references.
 * Similarly, the withdrawal thread must acquire two locks before it can enter its own innermost critical
 * code section. The outer lock associates with the String object that anotherSharedLock references, and the inner
 * lock associates with the FinTrans object that ft references. Suppose both threads' execution orders are such that
 * each thread acquires its outer lock. Thus, the deposit thread acquires its FinTrans lock, and the withdrawal thread
 * acquires its String lock. Now that both threads possess their outer locks, they are in their appropriate outer
 * critical code section. Both threads then attempt to acquire the inner locks, so they can enter the appropriate
 * inner critical code sections.
 * The deposit thread attempts to acquire the lock associated with the anotherSharedLock-referenced object.
 * However, the deposit thread must wait because the withdrawal thread holds that lock. Similarly, the withdrawal
 * thread attempts to acquire the lock associated with the ft-referenced object.
 * But the withdraw thread cannot acquire that lock because the deposit thread (which is waiting) holds it.
 * Therefore, the withdrawal thread must also wait. Neither thread can proceed because neither thread releases
 * the lock it holds. And neither thread can release the lock it holds because each thread is waiting.
 * Each thread deadlocks, and the program freezes.
